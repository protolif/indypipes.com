%p Here is what some of our Angie’s List customers have said about us:
.quote “They were always very pleasant & explained all my questions, worked hard to keep dirt & dust to minimum. Also what really made me feel good was though my house is only a 80,000 dollar home and not fancy, he understood it was my HOME and treated it like his own. I could & will highly recommend this company.”

.quote "Jim did a super job under trying conditions. He had a lot of good ideas that matched our needs...He is very much of a perfectionist and the work was meticulous. The price was quite reasonable for the work that was required. We are very pleased with the outcome and will certainly recommend him to others."

.quote “Same day service. Prompt, called several times to let me know his progress with other customers, fixed an extra gas leak, and cleaned up after himself. He was very nice... A+, I would recommend him to anyone.”

.quote "The owner talked to my husband over the phone to fix the leak in our garage at no cost. He saved us a service call and it was a very nice gesture. He even called back to make sure it stopped leaking."

.quote "Above & Beyond Plumbing replaced the works in a couple of toilets. We have a spigot in our garage just outside the entry door to the house that had leaked since we bought our home eleven years ago. He had to cut into the wall right inside our front door to get to the pipe and he replaced it. He also put a little white panel over the hole. He replaced all of the hoses on my washer machine with chrome mesh hoses. Everything has been working since he came out. He did a really neat job. He did an excellent job with all of the projects."
